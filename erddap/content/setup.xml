Create a new directory, outside of the tomcat directory, for this purpose.
The user that runs Tomcat must have read/write privileges for this directory.
Subdirectories that will be created by ERDDAP are:
* datasetInfo (which some datasets use to cache information about the dataset
   to speed up reloading the dataset in the future),
* flag (where you can put a file with a datasetID's name to force reloading of
   that dataset) and
* cache (which ERDDAP uses to hold cached data files - ERDDAP periodically
   removes files older than cacheMinutes (see below)).
The ERDDAP log file (log.txt) will be put in this directory.

At ERD, we use '/u00/cwatch/erddap/' for releases.

* lucene - is the best choice for more than about 10,000 datasets.
  The advantages are that with any number of datasets it works fast
  and uses very little memory.
  But there are many things that might go wrong with individual
  queries and with the whole system.

  it ranks them) is almost identical to the original search engine,
  it has a few quirky, subtle, small differences.

You MUST CHANGE this information when you install ERDDAP on your server since you can't use Bob's account.
If you don't actually want to send emails, change the emailSmtpHost tag contents to be nothing.

emailPassword is optional; if absent, emails can't be sent to non-local addresses.

emailProperties is a list of additional properties in the form

For example, gmail accounts need

At ERD, we use '60'.
Note that when a dataset is reloaded, all files in the [bigParentDirectory]cache/[datasetID]
directory are deleted.
In general, only image files are cached, because the same images are often requested repeatedly.
Removing files in the cache based on age (not Least-Recently-Used)
ensures that files won't stay in the cache very long.
Although it might seem like a given request should always return the same response,
that isn't true.
For example, a tabledap request which includes time>someTime will change
if new data arrives for the dataset.
And a griddap request which includes [last] for the time dimension will change
if new data arrives for the dataset.

If a given run of loadDatasets takes less than this time,

The default is 15 minutes, which should be fine for almost everyone.
No matter what, each dataset won't be reloaded more often than its
reloadEveryNMinutes value as specified in datasets.xml.

The only disadvantage to setting this to a smaller number is that
it will increase the frequency that ERDDAP retries datasets that aren't
loading. If there are lots of such datasets and they are retested frequently,
the data source might consider it pestering/aggressive behaviour.

In general, this should be set to at least twice as long as you reasonably

(since computers and networks sometimes are slower than expected)
This should always be much longer than loadDatasetsMinMinutes.
The default is 60 minutes.  Some people will set this to longer.

Why? On ERDDAP https: web pages, *all* links should use https: (not http:);
otherwise, most browsers consider the web page not fully secure.
Because ERDDAP would use the same .css file for http: and https: web pages,
the links within the .css file wouldn't switch between http: and https:.
There doesn't seem to be a way around this other than using inline style
